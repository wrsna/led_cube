# led_cube
This is project that was created 2015 with my friend we decided it will be cool to make an 8x8x8 RGB led cube, so we put heads together and figure it out.

All files are created with Eagle software it is more or less schematic and board view and backup files 

there are some images of the finished product and sadly no Arduino code to see it working that is still waiting to be written
